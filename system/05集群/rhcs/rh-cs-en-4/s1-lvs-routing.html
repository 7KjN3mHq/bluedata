>	  In the example, there are two NICs in the active LVS router. The NIC
	  for the Internet has a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>real IP address</I
> on eth0
	  and has a floating IP address aliased to eth0:1. The NIC for the
	  private network interface has a real IP address on eth1 and has a
	  floating IP address aliased to eth1:1. In the event of failover, the
	  virtual interface facing the Internet and the private facing virtual
	  interface are taken-over by the backup LVS router simultaneously. All
	  of the cluster's real servers located on the private network use the
	  floating IP for the NAT router as their default route to communicate
	  with the active LVS router so that their abilities to respond to
	  requests from the Internet is not impaired.
	</P
><P
>	  In this example, the LVS router's public LVS floating IP address and
	  private NAT floating IP address are aliased to two physical
	  NICs. While it is possible to associate each floating IP address to
	  its own physical device on the LVS router nodes, having more than two
	  NICs is not a requirement.
	</P
><P
>	  Using this topography, the active LVS router receives the request and
	  routes it to the appropriate server. The real server then processes
	  the request and returns the packets to the LVS router which uses
	  network address translation to replace the address of the real server
	  in the packets with the LVS routers public VIP address.  This process
	  is called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>IP masquerading</I
> because the actual IP
	  addresses of the real servers is hidden from the requesting clients.
	</P
><P
>	  Using this NAT routing, the real servers may be any kind of machine
	  running various operating systems. The main disadvantage is that the
	  LVS router may become a bottleneck in large cluster deployments
	  because it must process outgoing as well as incoming requests.
