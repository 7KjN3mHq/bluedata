<h1>HOWTO recover deleted files on an ext3 file system</h1>

<div id="date">Carlo Wood, Mar 2008</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It happens to everyone sooner or later: a split second after you hit Enter you realize
your mistake, but it's too late; you just deleted a valuable file or directory for
which no backup exists. Or maybe you have a backup, but it's a month old...
and in shock you see the past month flash before your eyes as you realize in pain
what you'll have to do all over again...</p>

<p>Fortunately, you remember that files are never <em>really</em> deleted, at most
overwritten by new content. So, you remount the disk read-only as fast as possible.
But now?</p>

<p>If you Google for "undelete ext3", almost every article you find will be
users asking if it's possible and the answer is every time: no.</p>

<p>The most frequently quoted passage comes from the <a href="http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/FAQs/ext3-faq.html">ext3 FAQ</a> itself:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Q: How can I recover (undelete) deleted files from my ext3 partition?</p>
<p>Actually, you can't! This is what one of the developers, Andreas Dilger, said about it:</p>

<p><i>In order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a
crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas
ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks
the inode as "deleted" and leaves the block pointers alone.</i></p>

<p><i>Your only hope is to "grep" for parts of your files that have been deleted and hope for the best.</i></p>
</div>

<p>However, this is not necessarily true.
<em>All</em> information might still be there, also the block pointers.
It is just less likely that those are still there (than on ext2),
since they have to be recovered from the journal.
On top of that, the meta data is less coherently related to the real
data so that heuristic algorithms are needed to find things back.
Every time a file is accessed, it's Access Time is changed, and it's
inode is written to disk, along with 31 other inodes that reside in
the same block. When that happens, a copy of that block is written
to the journal. Therefore, if your partition isn't too large compared
to your journal, and if you at least recently accessed the files you
want to recover, you might be able to recover the block pointers from
the journal.</p>

<p>On February 7th, 2008, I accidently deleted my whole home directory: over 3 GB of data, deleted with <code>rm -rf</code>.
The only backup that I had was from June 2007. Not being able to undelete was <em>unacceptable</em>. So, I ignored what
everyone tried to tell me and started to learn how an ext3 file system really works, and what <em>exactly</em>
happens when files are deleted...</p>

<p>Three weeks and nearly 5000 lines of code later, I had recovered every file on my disk.</p>

<h2>What You Should Know Before You Begin</h2>

<p>The tool that I wrote assumes a spike of <em>recently</em> deleted files (shortly before the last unmount).
It does NOT deal with a corrupted file system, only with accidently deleted files.</p>

<p>Also, the program is in a beta stage: the development of the program was
done as a hack, solely aimed at recovering my own data. After I recovered
my data I have continued development for one more month to address bugs that
didn't show in my case, but over all the program isn't as robust as it could be.
Therefore, it is likely that things might not work entirely out-of-the-box for you.
I stashed the program with <code>asserts</code>, which makes it likely that if
something doesn't work for you then the program will abort instead of trying to
gracefully recover. In that case you will have to dig deeper, and finish the
program yourself, so to say.</p>

<p>The program only needs read access to the file system with the deleted files:
it does not attempt to recover the files. Instead, it allows you to make a copy
of deleted files and writes those to a newly created directory tree in the
<em>current directory</em> (which obviously should be a different file system).
All paths are relative to the root of the partion,
thusâ€” if you are analysing a partition <code>/dev/md5</code> which was
mounted under <code>/home</code>, then <code>/home</code> is unknown to the
partition and to the program and therefore not part of the path(s). Instead,
a path will be something like for example "carlo/c++/foo.cc", without
leading slash. The parition root (<code>/home</code> in the example) is
the <em>empty</em> string, not '/'.</p>

<p>The name of the program, <code>ext3grep</code> was chosen because I was
planning to write a highly intelligent program that would be able to
reconstruct files by searching for blocks that looked <em>similar</em>
to expected blocks (based on an old backup, or other rules). The <em>grep</em>
in the name was in anticipation that the quote from the ext3 developer
was true: I was preparing for the need to work with sets of blocks, each
set corresponding to a search pattern and weighted with a likeliness, upon
which then one would have to work with set operators in order to reduce
the number of blocks and assign them to files, and give them their order.
However, nothing like it turned out to be needed. Nevertheless,
I kept the name <code>ext3grep</code> because someone might want to add
a true <code>grep</code>-like functionality to the program (at this
moment it's grep-functionality is limited to fixed strings, printing
matching block numbers to standard output).</p>

<h2>How Does EXT3 Store Files?</h2>

<h3>Block sizes</h3>

<p>The content of files is stored in contiguous blocks of 4096 bytes (the
actual size depends on command line parameters passed to mke2fs when the
file system was first created and can be 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes).
A harddisk is a "block device", meaning that every I/O is
done in terms those blocks; one can only read/write an integral number
of a blocks at a time. This doesn't necessarily mean that the minimum
size of a contiguous file fragment is of the same size (although it can
only be smaller), but in practise it is. In fact, the program will not
work if the fragment size is unequal the block size.</p>

<p>The actual block size, as well as the actual fragment size, are
stored in the superblock and can be retrieved with the option <code>--superblock</code>.
For example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | grep 'size:'
Block size: 4096
Fragment size: 4096
</pre>

<p>Here <code>IMAGE</code> is an environment variable that was set
to the name of the device (or a copy thereof made with <code>dd</code>)
of the partition holding the file system. For example <code>/dev/sdd2</code>
(in general, any of the device names as returned by the command <code>df</code>
under the heading "Filesystem"). Normally only root can read
devices directly, but you can (temporarily) make them readable by you,
of course, or make a backup image with dd. Note that, for example,
<code>/dev/sdd</code> is NOT a partition (note the missing digit) and
will not contain usable data for our purpose.</p>

<p>The entire partition is divided into an integral number of blocks,
starting to count at 0. Thus, if you ever want to make a copy of block
number N, you could do:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>$ dd if=$IMAGE bs=4096 count=1 skip=$N of=block.$N
</pre></div>

<p>Where N runs from 0 till (but not including) the number of blocks
as stored in the superblock. For example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | grep 'Blocks count:'
Blocks count: 2441824
</pre>

<p>Having any block number, one can print information about it
by using the command line option <code>--block</code>.
For example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --block 600
[...]
Group: 0
Block 600 is Allocated. It's inside the inode table of group 0 (inodes [1 - 33&gt;).

$ ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --block 1109
[...]
Group: 0

Block 1109 is a directory. The block is Allocated

          .-- File type in dir_entry (r=regular file, d=directory, l=symlink)
          |          .-- D: Deleted ; R: Reallocated
Indx Next |  Inode   | Deletion time                        Mode        File name

   1  end d       2                                         drwxr-xr-x  ..
   2    3 d      11  D 1202351093 Thu Feb  7 03:24:53 2008  drwxr-xr-x  lost+found
   3  end d  195457  D 1202352103 Thu Feb  7 03:41:43 2008  drwxr-xr-x  carlo
</pre>

<h3>The superblock</h3>

<p>The superblock isn't really a block. It's size is always 1024 bytes and the
first superblock starts at offset 1024. Thus, if the block size is
1024 then the superblock is block 1, but if the block size is 2048 or
4096, then the superblock is part of block 0. There are multiple
backup copies elsewhere on the disk. <code>ext3grep</code> assumes that
the first superblock is not corrupted and does not attempt to find or
read the backup copies.</p>

<p>One could read the contents of the first superblock with dd as follows:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>$ dd if=$IMAGE bs=1024 skip=1 count=1 of=superblock
</pre></div>

<p>The meaning of each byte in the superblock is given in table 1.</p>

<p>The C-struct for the superblock is given in the header file <code>/usr/include/linux/ext3_fs.h</code>
and was used to create table 1.
The data of the unsigned integers is stored on disk in Little Endian format.
On a little endian CPU like Intel x86, that means that <code>__le32</code> is in fact an <code>uint32_t</code>
and <code>__le16</code> is equal to <code>uint16_t</code>.</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>

<p>Each ext3 file system is devided into groups, with a fixed number of
blocks per group, except the last group which contains the remaining blocks.
The number of blocks per group is given in the superblock, ie</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | grep 'Blocks per group'
# Blocks per group: 32768
</pre>

<p>Each group uses one block as a bitmap to keep track of which block
inside that group is allocated (used); thus, there can be at most 4096 * 8 = 32768
normal blocks per group.</p>

<p>Another block is used as bitmap for the number of allocated inodes.
Inodes are data structures of 128 bytes (they can be extended in theory;
the real size is given in the superblock once again) that are stored in a table,
(4096 / 128 = 32 inodes per block) in each group.
Having at most 32768 bits in the bitmap, we can conclude that there will be at
most 32768 inodes per group, and thus 32768 / 32  = 1024 blocks in the inode
table of each group. The actual size of the inode table is given by the actual
number of inodes per group, which is also stored in the superblock.</p><p>

</p><pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | egrep 'Size of inode|inodes per group'
Number of inodes per group: 16288
Size of inode structure: 128
</pre>

<p>The block numbers of both bitmaps and the start of the inode table
is given in the "group descriptor table", which resides in
the block following the superblock; thus, block 1 or block 2 depending
on the size of a block. This group descriptor table exists of a series
of consecutive <code>ext3_group_desc</code> structs, also defined in
<code>/usr/include/linux/ext3_fs.h</code>, see table 2.</p>

<table class="struct">

</tbody></table>

<p>Since the size of this struct is padded to a power of 2, 32 bytes, there
fit precisely an integral number of descriptors in a block. Therefore the table
is contiguous even when spanning multiple blocks. Note that one block of
4096 bytes is already capable of holding 128 group descriptors, each of which
can store 32768 blocksâ€” thus only a partition larger than 16 GB
will use more than one block for the group descriptor table.</p>

<p>The content of the table is printed by <code>ext3grep</code> if
no action or group is specified on the command line. For example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE 
No action specified; implying --superblock.

<h3>Inodes</h3>

<p>The inodes in the inode table of each group contain meta data for each type
of data that the file system can store. This type might be a symbolic link,
in which case only the inode is sufficient, it might be a directory, a file,
a FIFO, a UNIX socket and so on.
In the case of files and directories the real data is stored in file system
blocks outside the inode.
The first 12 block numbers are stored in the inode,
if more blocks are needed, then then the inode points to an indirect block:
a block with more block numbers that contain data. Subsequently the inode
can store a double indirect block and a triple indirect block.
The structure of an inode is given in table 3.</p>

<p>The C-struct for the inode, <code>struct ext3_inode</code>,
is given in the header file <code>/usr/include/linux/ext3_fs.h</code> and was used to create table 3.
That same header file also defines a number of constants in the form of macros that should
be used to access the data. For example, the struct member that is stored in bytes 40 to 99
is <code>i_block</code>, it's size is <code>EXT3_N_BLOCKS</code> 32-bit block numbers.
<code>i_block[EXT3_IND_BLOCK]</code> points to (contains the block number of) an indirect block
if one exists. <code>i_block[EXT3_DIND_BLOCK]</code> to a double indirect block and
<code>i_block[EXT3_TIND_BLOCK]</code> to a tripple indirect block. Basically, every constant
has it's macro, see the header file for more details. <code>ext3grep</code> uses
<code>i_reserved2</code> to store the inode number, so that printing an <code>ext3_inode</code>
struct in gdb shows which inode it really is.</p>

<p>The superblock shows how many inodes exist in total, and how many inodes there are per group.
This allows one to calculate the number of groups. Because the inodes are stored in their
respective inode tables per group, one first has to determine the group that an inode number
belongs to. Because inodes start to count at 1, the formula to convert an inode number to
the group it belongs to is:</p>

<pre>group = (inode_number - 1) / inodes_per_group
</pre>

<p>This gives the correct inode table. To find the index of the inode in this table
we subtract the inode number of the first inode in the table from our inode number:</p>

<pre>index = inode_number - (group * inodes_per_group + 1)
</pre>

<p>Note that this index also determines the corresponding bit in the inodes bitmap.</p>

<p>As such, groups have been made transparent: every inode can be addressed with
a number in the contiguous range <code>[1, number_of_inodes]</code>, where
the number of inodes is given by:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | grep 'Inodes count'
Inodes count: 1221600
</pre>

<p>In some case you might want to know which block in the file system belongs
to the inode table that stores a particular inode. This can be retrieved with
the command line option <code>--inode-to-block</code>, for example:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --inode-to-block 2
[...]
Inode 2 resides in block 600 at offset 0x80.
</pre>

<p>Inode number 2 (the macro <code>EXT3_ROOT_INO</code> in <code>ext3_fs.h</code>)
is always used for the root of the partition: it's type is a directory.
Of all other special inodes we only use EXT3_JOURNAL_INO (number 8).</p>

<p>Having the inode number, one can print it's contents with <code>ext3grep</code>,
for example:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --inode 2 --print
Number of groups: 75

<p>As you see, <code>ext3grep</code> first dumps the hexadecimal content of
the inode table; then interprets it and prints the struct members, ending with
the line <code>Direct Blocks: 1109</code>. It then detects that this block is
a directory (which can also be seen in the mode field of the inode) and
therefore continuous with listing this block as directory.</p>

<h3>Regular Files</h3>

<p>If an inode represents a regular file, then the blocks it refers to
simply contain the data of the file. If the size of a file is not an integral
number of times the block size, than the excess bytes in the last block
will be zeroed out (at least, on linux).</p>

<h3>Symbolic links</h3>

<p>The value of a symbolic link is a string: the pathname to it's target.
The length of the string is given in <code>i_size</code>.
If <code>i_blocks</code> is zero, then <code>i_block</code>
does <em>not</em> contain block numbers, but is used to store the string directly.
However, if the name of the target is longer than fits in <code>i_block</code>,
then <code>i_blocks</code> will be non-zero and <code>i_block[0]</code> will
point to a block containing the target name.</p>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p>If an inode represents a directory then its blocks are (singly) linked lists of <code>ext3_dir_entry_2</code> data structures.
Each block is self-contained: no dir entry points outside the block.
The first block will always start with the dir entries for "." and "..".</p>

<p>Using the options <code>--ls --inode $N</code>, <code>ext3grep</code>
lists the contents of each directory block of inode N. For example,
to list the root directory of a partition:</p>

<p>Subsequently, one could use <code>ext3grep --ls --inode 195457</code> to
list directory <code>carlo</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Note that <code>ext3grep</code> prints all directory entries, deleted not.
There are two ways that one can see that a directory is deleted: firstly,
it's inode will have a non-zero Deletion Time, secondly the dir entry might
be taken out of the linked list by skipping it; the "Directory Entry Length",
bytes 4 and 5 of each directory entry, basically 'point' to the next entry,
or to the byte directly following the block if there are no other dir entries.
In the listing of <code>ext2grep</code> the address of the dir entries has
has been replaced by an artificial index (in the first column) and the "Directory Entry Length"
is replaced with the column called <code>Next</code>, which either points to the next
entry or contains <code>end</code> when there are no other dir entries. In the
above example, 0 is the first entry, 1 is the next and last entry. The entries
with index 2 and 3 are skipped. However, it is still visible that entry 2 used to
point to entry 3. In fact, entries 2 and 3 are deleted at the same time by
changing the "Directory Entry Length" of entry 1 such that it did
not 'point' to entry 2 anymore, but to the end of the block.</p>

<p>Because <code>ext3grep</code> prints also deleted entries, it is very
well possible that the SAME entry occurs multiple times. In particular, if
a file is moved, a duplicate remains that will still be visible. Ie,</p>

<p>In order to understand this, the following remarks.</p>

<p>Firstly, these duplicated entries come mostly from duplicated directory blocks,
which is already apparent from the index number of the entries: if they were all
from the same block then all index numbers would have been different. Of course,
without piping the output to <code>grep</code> it would be clear that each entry
belongs to a different directory block, but that output is too much to show here.</p>

<p>Secondly, you have to realize that only the inode number, the file type in
the third column and the file name is data from the dir entry itself. The
Deletion time, and the Mode column are extracted from the current data in
the corresponding inode. However, that inode could have been reused long ago
by another file and the data it contains would not be related anymore to
this dir entry. This is clearly the case in the above example because it
is certain that all those .viminfo files weren't deleted on the same day!
In a <em>few</em> case it can be detected that an inode has been reallocated (reused):
if it is still in use (that can't be by this <em>deleted</em> dir entry), or when the
file type in the inode differs from the file type in the dir entry. In those cases
the fifth column shows an 'R' instead of a 'D', and the content of the
inode is not shown. However, because such entries show little information of
use, they are normally suppressed. If you want to see entries with known
reallocated inodes, you have to add the command line option <code>--reallocated</code>.
Moreover, sometimes the inode number in the dir entry itself is zeroed.
Such entries are obviously useless as well and therefore also suppressed.
In order to show them use the command line option <code>--zeroed-inodes</code>.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply filters to the output of <code>--ls</code>.
An overview of the available filters is given in the output of the <code>--help</code> option:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --help
[...]
Filters:
  --group grp            Only process group 'grp'.
  --directory            Only process directory inodes.
  --after dtime          Only entries deleted on or after 'dtime'.
  --before dtime         Only entries deleted before 'dtime'.
  --deleted              Only show/process deleted entries.
  --allocated            Only show/process allocated inodes/blocks.
  --unallocated          Only show/process unallocated inodes/blocks.
  --reallocated          Do not suppress entries with reallocated inodes.
                         Inodes are considered 'reallocated' if the entry
                         is deleted but the inode is allocated, but also when
                         the file type in the dir entry and the inode are
                         different.
  --zeroed-inodes        Do not suppress entries with zeroed inodes. Linked
                         entries are always shown, regardless of this option.
  --depth depth          Process directories recursively up till a depth
                         of 'depth'.

</pre>

<p>In order to easily determine sensible values for <code>--after</code> and <code>--before</code>
the action <code>--histogram=dtime</code> was added. This command line option causes <code>ext3grep</code>
to print a histogram of time versus number of deleted inodes. If you delete a large number of
files at once, for example with <code>rm -rf</code>, then it should be easy to determine a time
window within which the deletion took place.
For example, here I zoomed in on my personal disaster where I deleted a little over fifty
thousand files from my home directory:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --histogram=dtime --after=1202351086 --before=1202351129

<h3>The Journal</h3>

<p>The journal is a file existing of a fixed number of blocks.
It's inode is <code>EXT3_JOURNAL_INO</code>, which is usually 8.

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --superblock | grep 'Inode number of journal file'
Inode number of journal file: 8
</pre>

<p>and the size then can be found by printing inode 8:</p>

Indirect Block: 1127
Double Indirect Block: 2152
</pre>

<p>where you can see that the size of my journal is 134217728 bytes, or
32768 blocks. The first 12 blocks are listed directly in the inode:
blocks 1115 - 1126. Then an indirect block is placed in 1127. This
indirect block can contain 1024 block numbers each of which follow
the indirect block directly (1128 - 2151). Then the inode refers to
a double indirect block containing 31 block numbers of additional
indirect blocks. The total number of (double/tripple) indirect
blocks is calculated to be 34 (using the fact that a sector is 512 byte).
Therefore, if everything would be stored contiguously, the last block of
the journal would be 1115 + 32768 + 34 - 1 = 33916. However, the journal
didn't fit entirely in group 0, so the last blocks are in group 1 and
the header of group 1 (most notably it's inode table) is inserted
somewhere between the journal blocks, causing the last block to be 35025.
On top of this, there could be bad blocks anywhere in between as well.
Therefore, the correct way to approach the journal is in terms of
'journal block numbers'.</p>

<p>The first block of the journal file (block 1115 in the above example)
contains the 'journal superblock'. It's structure is defined in
<code>/usr/include/linux/jbd.h</code> as <code>journal_superblock_t</code>.
It can be printed with:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --journal --superblock
Journal Super Block:

Loading journal descriptors... done
Journal transaction 4381435 wraps around, some data blocks might have been lost of this transaction.
Number of descriptors in journal: 30258; min / max sequence numbers: 4379495 / 4382264
</pre>

<p>Here you can see that the journal actually starts in Journal Block Number 1, and the
last block is Journal Block Number 32768. These are thus not the same as the file system block numbers.
One can find the real block number with, for example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --journal --journal-block 1
[...]
Group: 0
Block 1116 belongs to the journal.
[...]
</pre>

<p>which reveals that Journal Block Number 1 is file system block 1116.</p>

<p>The journal is filled with "Transactions" which have an ever increasing
sequence number. If the end of the journal is reached, writing continuous at
the start, wrapping around. However, if a file system is cleanly unmounted
then the next mount writing always starts at the beginning (I think).</p>

<p>A single transaction exists of a one or more "Descriptors".
The last descriptor of a transaction is a "Commit Block", signaling
that the transaction has been closed succesfully and the data in the previous
descriptors of that transaction has been written to disk. There are two other
types of descriptors: revoke blocks and blocks containing "tags".
A revoke block is filled with block numbers that should be (or are) unallocated
by this transaction. A tag is a structure that assigns subsequent journal blocks
(not file system blocks!) to file system blocks: the following journal blocks
contain the data that should (have been) written to the given file system block.</p>

<p>That makes "tags" in particular interesting for us: they contain
copies of data that was written to disk in the past, including old inodes.</p>

<h3>Manual recovery example</h3>

<p>In the following example we will manually recover a small file.
Only partial output is given in order to save space and to make the
example more readable.</p>

<p>Using <code>ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --inode</code> we find the name of
the file that we want to recover:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --inode 2 | grep carlo
   3  end d  195457  D 1202352103 Thu Feb  7 03:41:43 2008  drwxr-xr-x  carlo

$ ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --inode 195457 | grep ' bin$' | head -n 1
  34   35 d  309540  D 1202352104 Thu Feb  7 03:41:44 2008  drwxr-xr-x  bin

$ ext3grep $IMAGE --ls --inode 309540 | grep start_azureus
   9   10 r  309631  D 1202351093 Thu Feb  7 03:24:53 2008  rrwxr-xr-x  start_azureus
</pre>

<p>Obviously, inode 309631 is erased and we have no block numbers for this file:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --print --inode 309631

Direct Blocks:
</pre>

<p>Therefore, we will try to look for an older copy of it in the journal.
First, we find the file system block that contains this inode:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --inode-to-block 309631 | grep resides
Inode 309631 resides in block 622598 at offset 0xf00.
</pre>

<p>Then we find all journal descriptors referencing block 622598:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --journal --block 622598
[...]
Journal descriptors referencing block 622598:
4381294 26582
4381311 28693
4381313 28809
4381314 28814
4381321 29308
4381348 30676
4381349 30986
4381350 31299
4381374 32718
4381707 1465
4381709 2132
4381755 2945
4381961 4606
4382098 6073
4382137 6672
4382138 7536
4382139 7984
4382140 8931
</pre>

<p>This means that the transaction with sequence number 4381294 has a copy
of block 622598 in block 26582, and so on. The largest sequence number,
at the bottom, should be the last data written to disk and thus block
8931 should be the same as the current block 622598. In order to find
the last non-deleted copy, one should start at the bottom and work upwards.</p>

<p>If you try to print such a block, ext3grep recognizes that it's a block
from an inode table and will print the contents of all 32 inodes in it.
We only wish to see inode 309631 however; so we use a smart grep:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --print --block 8931 | grep -A15 'Inode 309631'

Direct Blocks:
</pre>

<p>This is indeed the same as we saw in block 622598. Next we
look at smaller sequence numbers until we find one with a
0 Deletion time. The first one that we find (bottom up) is
block 6073:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --print --block 6073 | grep -A15 'Inode 309631'

<p>The above is automated and can be done much faster with the command line option <code>--show-journal-inodes</code>.
This option will find the block that the inode belongs to, then finds all copies of that block in the journal,
and subsequently prints only the requested inode from each of these block (each of which contains 32 inodes, as you know),
eliminating duplicates:</p>

<p>Recovered!</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to see all descriptors of a given transaction.
The transaction that we used to recover this file was 4382098. The complete
transaction can be seen with:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --journal-transaction 4382098
[...]
Prev / Current / Next sequences numbers: 4382097 4382098 4382099
Transaction was NOT COMMITTED!
TAG: 6074=851971 6073=622598 6072=393218 6071=393395 6070=393231 6069=393409 6068=393240 6067=393371 6066=622596

</pre>

<p>Here you see, for example, the TAG <code>6072=393218</code>, meaning that block 6072 contains a (old) copy of block 393218.
I don't know why it says that the transaction wasn't committed (that seems very unlikely). Probably, the commit block
was overwritten and this old journal transaction simply isn't complete anymore.</p>

<h3>Recovering files</h3>

<p>Of course, it would be annoying to recover larger files, existing of many blocks this way;
let alone manually recovering thousands of files! Therefore all of the above can be automated.
However, if you recover 50,000 files then there is virtually no way to even check if it worked
afterwards: especially when MORE files were recovered than you really wanted; it will be
hard to find back all the junk. You really should take care to recover files as accurate as
possible.</p>

<p>No such care seems necessary to recover a single file,
you can just pass it's path to <code>ext3grep</code>:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --restore-file carlo/bin/start_kvm
[...]
Restoring carlo/bin/start_kvm

$ cat RESTORED_FILES/carlo/bin/start_kvm
#! /bin/sh
cd /usr/src/qgt/src
./host-linux 192.168.2.4 &amp;
cd /opt/kvm/winXPpro
sudo modprobe kvm_intel
sudo kvm -m 384 -hda vdisk6GB.img -cdrom /dev/cdrom -localtime -std-vga -net nic,vlan=0,model=rtl8139 -net tap,vlan=0
#-snapshot # -daemonize
killall -9 host-linux
</pre>

<p>Note that this created the directory <code>RESTORED_FILES/carlo/bin</code> in the current directory, in order to be able to restore this file.
Also note that if <code>RESTORED_FILES/carlo/bin/start_kvm</code> already existed in the current directory then it was <em>not</em> overwritten!</p>

<p>In order for this to work you will first have to pass stage1 and stage2 of the disk analysis that <code>ext3grep</code> will perform (see below).</p>

<p>It is possible to dump all file names that <code>ext3grep</code> can find, using the command line option <code>--dump-names</code>:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --dump-names
carlo
carlo/.Trash
carlo/.Xauthority
carlo/.Xauthority-c
carlo/.Xauthority-l
carlo/.Xauthority-n
carlo/.alsaplayer
carlo/.alsaplayer/alsaplayer.m3u
carlo/.alsaplayer/config
[...]

lost+found/1st level admin borders (states_provinces)
lost+found/1st level admin names (states_provinces)
lost+found/2002 - cloud cover (0-10%)
[...]
</pre>

<p>The files that will end up in <code>lost+found</code> are files for which no directory could
be found (but that still had an inode copy in the journal). Most likely those are files that were
deleted long ago and can be disgarded anyway.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied with the output of <code>--dump-names</code>, you can replace <code>--dump-names</code>
with <code>--restore-all</code>, which in effect will cause <code>--restore-file</code> to be called on every
file name printed by <code>--dump-names</code>. As mentioned before, it is highly advisable to use a proper
<code>--after</code> command line option in order to avoid that <code>ext3grep</code> tries to recover files
that are simply too old. Note that at this moment the output of <code>--dump-names</code> is unfiltered,
and <code>--restore-file</code> (<code>--restore-all</code>) <em>only</em> honors the <code>--after</code>
command line option.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ time ext3grep $IMAGE --restore-all --after=1202351117

</pre>

<p>where <code>carlo/bin/startx</code> is the only file recovered. It was the <em>last</em>
file that was deleted, and I set the <code>--after</code> value to one second before it was.
Note that it's logical that it was the last file, since I started X by executing this
script; hence, it was "in use" until I rebooted.</p>

<p>Considering that it checked over 50,000 files from a in total 10 GB large partition,
the 3.1 seconds is extremely fast; this is caused by several factors:
1) The first time <code>ext3grep</code> is run, it does a full analysis of the partition
and writes the results to a cache file (in two steps, first stage1 and then stage2).
These stages only need to be done once.
2) Since only one file had to be recovered, there wasn't much disk access (besides, I
have 4 GB of RAM -- so everything needed was already cached). 3) I have a very fast cpu.
It was using 100% cpu during those 3.1 seconds though. Trying to restore many files
mainly hangs on disk access, but is relatively still pretty fast (you can just sit
and wait for it).</p>

<h3>Stage 1</h3>

<p>The stage 1 cache file is written to <code>DEVICE.ext3grep.stage1</code>, where <code>DEVICE</code> is
replaced with the device name (ie, if <code>$IMAGE</code> is <code>/dev/hda2</code>,
then <code>DEVICE</code> is <code>hda2</code>). There is little that can go wrong with
stage 1: it just scans the whole disk and finds all blocks that seem to contain a directory.</p>

<p>The format of the stage1 cache file is:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>$ cat md5.ext3grep.stage1
# Stage 1 data for md5.
# Inodes and directory start blocks that use it for dir entry '.'.
# INODE : BLOCK [BLOCK ...]
2 : 1109 6592 9312
11 : 1110
195457 : 415744
195468 : 2916 4732 17783 403469
195469 : 403470
[...]
929633 : 1885254
929659 : 1885280
# Extended directory blocks.
1178
1179
1182
[...]
1884516
</pre></div>

<p>In the first part, the first column are inodes, followed by a space, followed by a colon,
followed by a space seperated list of block numbers that use that inode for a dir entry with name ".".
Obviously, there can only be one directory that uses this inode, so <code>ext3grep</code> has
to determine which of those block numbers is the last one that was the real one. The second part
lists all block numbers that contain extended directory blocks, that is, directory blocks that
are not the first block and do not contain the dir_entry with name ".". It is unknown which
directory those belong to without having the original inode. In stage 2 <code>ext3grep</code>
will attempt to find out to which directory they belong.</p>

<h3>Stage 2</h3>

<p>This stage, executed by the function <code>init_directories()</code>, contains most heuristic code.
First it determines which blocks are the real directory
start blocks, and then assigns each extended directory block to one of those directories (see
also TODO, below). As a result it is possible to assign a path name to each (directory) inode,
and assign a list of directory blocks to them. Finally, this result is written to a cache file
(<code>DEVICE.ext3grep.stage2</code>). In case something goes very wrong here, you might be
able to fix it by editing this file (removing incorrect-, or adding correct block numbers),
however, do not remove or add comments: <code>ext3grep</code> will get confused if you change
the file too much.</p>

<h3>locate database</h3>

<p>I'm afraid that I used one more thing, besides just the data
on my partition to recover my files: I still had my <code>/var</code> partition
and therefore still had the <code>locate</code> database (in <code>/var/cache/locate/locatedb</code>).
I used it to make a list of all file names that were deleted and wrote it to a file
<code>locate_output</code>, with the format:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>carlo
carlo/.Trash
carlo/.Xauthority
[...]
</pre></div>

<p>in other words, the same format as the output of <code>--dump-names</code>.
This file is being opened and used by the function <code>load_locate_data</code>,
in the source file <code>locate.cc</code>, which fills <code>filename_to_locatepath_map</code>.
That map is subsequently used by the function <code>parent_directory</code> in
order to make an educated guess about what the correct parent directory is of
a given filename.</p>

<p>Even then, because my locate database file wasn't complete, I needed to manually
add hacks. In particular, it is possible to add a hardcoded list of regular
expressions to <code>locate.cc</code> that causes a specified parent directory to
be returned. Still, I also hardcoded the translation of three (directory) block
numbers to "<code>lost+found</code>". It might be needed to tune/hack this part of the code
if you want to be succesful in cleanly recovering your data to the correct
directory.</p>

<p>If you see messages of the form:</p>

<pre>Could not find an inode for extended directory at BLOCKNR, disregarding it's contents.
</pre>

<p>Then please read <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ext3grep/msg/370b2a31a37a66fd">this post</a> entirely, for more information.</p>

<h2>Superfluous hardlinks</h2>

<p>Because inodes are reused, it happens often that an old directory entry (of a deleted file,
or in a deleted directory, or in an old directory block that is not used anymore) refers to
an inode that is now used by something else. If that something else is of the same type (both
regular files) then there is no way to distinguish it from a hardlink: two files using the
same inode. As a result, a recovery results in a lot of WRONG hardlinks.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier to clean these up, <code>ext3grep</code> provides the
command line option <code>--show-hardlinks</code>.

</p><pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --show-hardlinks
[...]
Inode 309562:
  carlo/bin/pc++ (309540)
  carlo/bin/pcc (309540)
  carlo/bin/pcc.unlock (309540)
Inode 702474:
  carlo/projects/libcwd/libcwd/.svn/entries (700387)
  carlo/projects/libcwd/libcwd/testsuite/tst_flush.o (700609)
[...]
</pre>

<p>Here, the hardlinks for inode 309562 are correct. The hardlink for inode 702474
is wrong, and one of the files should be deleted. After you manually determined which
file is wrong and deleted it; it will not show up again when you rerun this command:
Only those hardlinks are reported that still exist in the output directory: you
can only use <code>--show-hardlinks</code> <em>after</em> running <code>--restore-all</code>,
or it will not result in any output since no output file exists.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>The program has been written <em>while</em> I was learning how ext3 works. It's earliest
functionality is therefore not depending on things that I wrote later. An advantage is that
those functionalities are faster and will still work if the later code is broken; they are
also more down-to-earth, so you can use them to check what is really going on without
depending on the more complex (and heuristic) code that was added later. However, there are
also disadvantages: The filtering code that I wrote for <code>--ls</code> is not being
used by the later written code that handles <code>--dump-names</code> and <code>--restore-all</code>.
Also, stage 2 is resolved without using the journal as would be possible by using code
written later. It is not easy to change that because that code uses the results of stage 2.
I think that a better algorithm to find which blocks are the correct ones for the last
copy of a directory would be the same as how I finally recovered files: by finding the last
non-deleted inode of that directory in the journal. This is not how it currently works though.</p>

<h2>Command line options</h2>

<p>All command line options are listed by providing <code>--help</code> on the command line:</p>

<pre class="ext3grep">$ ext3grep $IMAGE --help
Usage: ext3grep [options] [--] device-file
Options:
  --version, -[vV]       Print version and exit successfully.
  --help,                Print this help and exit successfully.
  --superblock           Print contents of superblock in addition to the rest.
                         If no action is specified then this option is implied.
  --print                Print content of block or inode, if any.
  --ls                   Print directories with only one line per entry.
                         This option is often needed to turn on filtering.
  --accept filen         Accept 'filen' as a legal filename.
                         Can be used multiple times.
  --journal              Show content of journal.
  --show-path-inodes     Show the inode of each directory component in paths.
Filters:
  --group grp            Only process group 'grp'.
  --directory            Only process directory inodes.
  --after dtime          Only entries deleted on or after 'dtime'.
  --before dtime         Only entries deleted before 'dtime'.
  --deleted              Only show/process deleted entries.
  --allocated            Only show/process allocated inodes/blocks.
  --unallocated          Only show/process unallocated inodes/blocks.
  --reallocated          Do not suppress entries with reallocated inodes.
                         Inodes are considered 'reallocated' if the entry
                         is deleted but the inode is allocated, but also when
                         the file type in the dir entry and the inode are
                         different.
  --zeroed-inodes        Do not suppress entries with zeroed inodes. Linked
                         entries are always shown, regardless of this option.
  --depth depth          Process directories recursively up till a depth
                         of 'depth'.
Actions:
  --inode-to-block ino   Print the block that contains inode 'ino'.
  --inode ino            Show info on inode 'ino'.
                         If --ls is used and the inode is a directory, then
                         the filters apply to the entries of the directory.
                         If you do not use --ls then --print is implied.
  --block blk            Show info on block 'blk'.
                         If --ls is used and the block is the first block
                         of a directory, then the filters apply to entries
                         of the directory.
                         If you do not use --ls then --print is implied.
  --histogram=[atime|ctime|mtime|dtime|group]
                         Generate a histogram based on the given specs.
                         Using atime, ctime or mtime will change the
                         meaning of --after and --before to those times.
  --journal-block jblk   Show info on journal block 'jblk'.
  --journal-transaction seq
                         Show info on transaction with sequence number 'seq'.
  --dump-names           Write the path of files to stdout.
                         This implies --ls but suppresses it's output.
  --search-start str     Find blocks that start with the fixed string 'str'.
  --search str           Find blocks that contain the fixed string 'str'.
  --search-inode blk     Find inodes that refer to block 'blk'.
  --search-zeroed-inodes Return allocated inode table entries that are zeroed.
  --inode-dirblock-table dir
                         Print a table for directory path 'dir' of directory
                         block numbers found and the inodes used for each file.
  --show-journal-inodes ino
                         Show copies of inode 'ino' still in the journal.
  --restore-file 'path'  Will restore file 'path'. 'path' is relative to root
                         of the partition and does not start with a '/' (it
                         must be one of the paths returned by --dump-names).
                         The restored directory, file or symbolic link is
                         created in the current directory as ./'path'.
  --restore-all          As --restore-file but attempts to restore everything.
                         The use of --after is highly recommended because the
                         attempt to restore very old files will only result in
                         them being hard linked to a more recently deleted file
                         and as such polute the output.
  --show-hardlinks       Show all inodes that are shared by two or more files.

<p>New functionality was more or less added top down, so this also gives
