>      Red Hat Enterprise Linux LVS clustering uses a Linux machine called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>active
      router</I
> to send requests from the Internet to a pool of
      servers. To accomplish this, LVS clusters consist of two basic machine
      classifications &#8212; the LVS routers (one active and one backup) and a
      pool of real servers which provide the critical services.
    </P
><P
>      The active router serves two roles in the cluster:
    </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>To balance the load on the real servers.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>To check the integrity of the services on each of the real
	  servers.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>      The backup router's job is to monitor the active router and
      assume its role in the event of failure.

>Figure 7-1</A
> shows a simple LVS cluster consisting of
	two layers. On the first layer are two LVS routers &#8212; one active
	and one backup. Each of the LVS routers has two network interfaces, one
	interface on the Internet and one on the private network, enabling them
	to regulate traffic between the two networks. For this example the
	active router is using <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Network Address
	Translation</I
> or <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>NAT</I
> to direct traffic
	from the Internet to a variable number of real servers on the second
	layer, which in turn provide the necessary services. Therefore, the real
	servers in this example are connected to a dedicated private network
	segment and pass all public traffic back and forth through the active
	LVS router. To the outside world, the server cluster appears as one
	entity.

>        Service requests arriving at the LVS cluster are addressed to a
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>virtual IP</I
> address or VIP. This is a
        publicly-routable address the administrator of the site associates with
        a fully-qualified domain name, such as www.example.com, and which is
        assigned to one or more <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>virtual server</I
><A
NAME="AEN4267"
HREF="#FTN.AEN4267"

>. Note that a VIP address migrates from one LVS router to the
        other during a failover, thus maintaining a presence at that IP address,
        also known as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>floating IP addresses</I
>.
      </P
><P
>	VIP addresses may be aliased to the same device which
	connects the LVS router to the Internet. For instance, if eth0 is
	connected to the Internet, than multiple virtual servers can be
	aliased to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0:1</TT
>. Alternatively, each virtual
	server can be associated with a separate device per service. For example,
	HTTP traffic can be handled on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0:1</TT
>, and FTP
	traffic can be handled on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0:2</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>        Only one LVS router is active at a time. The role of the active router
        is to redirect service requests from virtual IP addresses to the real
        servers. The redirection is based on one of eight supported
        load-balancing algorithms described further in <A
HREF="s1-lvs-scheduling.html"
>Section 7.3 <I
>LVS Scheduling Overview</I
></A
>.
      </P
><P
>	The active router also dynamically monitors the overall health of the
	specific services on the real servers through simple
	<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>send/expect scripts</I
>. To aid in detecting the
	health of services that require dynamic data, such as HTTPS or SSL, the
	administrator can also call external executables. If a service on a real
	server malfunctions, the active router stops sending jobs to that server
	until it returns to normal operation.
      </P
><P
>        The backup router performs the role of a standby system. Periodically,
        the LVS routers exchange heartbeat messages through the primary external
        public interface and, in a failover situation, the private
        interface. Should the backup node fail to receive a heartbeat message
        within an expected interval, it initiates a failover and assumes the
        role of the active router. During failover, the backup router takes over
        the VIP addresses serviced by the failed router using a technique known
        as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>ARP spoofing</I
> &#8212; where the backup LVS
        router announces itself as the destination for IP packets addressed to
        the failed node. When the failed node returns to active service, the
        backup node assumes its hot-backup role again.
      </P
><P
>	The simple, two-layered configuration used in <A
HREF="ch-lvs-overview.html#GR-LVS-BASIC"
>Figure 7-1</A
> is best for clusters serving data which does
	  not change very frequently &#8212; such as static webpages &#8212;
	  because the individual real servers do not automatically sync data
	  between each node.

>	Since there is no built-in component in LVS clustering to share the same
	data between the real servers, the administrator has two basic options:
      </P

><UL
><LI
><P
>Synchronize the data across the real server pool</P

><LI
><P
>Add a third layer to the topology for shared data access</P

	numbers of users to upload or change data on the real servers. If the
	cluster allows large numbers of users to modify data, such as an
	e-commerce website, adding a third layer is preferable.

>7.1.1.1. Configuring Real Servers to Synchronize Data</A
></H3
><P
>	    There are many ways an administrator can choose to synchronize data
	    across the pool of real servers. For instance, shell scripts can be
	    employed so that if a Web engineer updates a page, the page is posted to
	    all of the servers simultaneously. Also, the cluster administrator can
	    use programs such as <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsync</TT
> to replicate changed data
	    across all nodes at a set interval.
	  </P
><P
>	    However, this type of data synchronization does not optimally
	    function if the cluster is overloaded with users constantly
	    uploading files or issuing database transactions. For a cluster with
	    a high load, a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>three-tiered topology</I
> is the
	    ideal solution.
