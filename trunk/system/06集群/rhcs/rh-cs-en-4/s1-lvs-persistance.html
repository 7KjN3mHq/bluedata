>	In certain situations, it may be desirable for a client to reconnect
	repeatedly to the same real server, rather than have an LVS load
	balancing algorithm send that request to the best available
	server. Examples of such situations include multi-screen web forms,
	cookies, SSL, and FTP connections. In these cases, a client may not work
	properly unless the transactions are being handled by the same server to
	retain context. LVS provides two different features to handle this:
	<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>persistence</I
> and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>firewall
	marks</I
>.

NAME="S2-LVS-PERSITENCE"

></H2
><P
>	  When enabled, persistence acts like a timer. When a client connects to
	  a service, LVS remembers the last connection for a specified period of
	  time. If that same client IP address connects again within that
	  period, it is sent to the same server it connected to previously
	  &#8212; bypassing the load-balancing mechanisms. When a connection
	  occurs outside the time window, it is handled according to the
	  scheduling rules in place.
	</P
><P
>	  Persistence also allows the administrator to specify a subnet mask to
	  apply to the client IP address test as a tool for controlling what
	  addresses have a higher level of persistence, thereby grouping
	  connections to that subnet.
	</P
><P
>	  Grouping connections destined for different ports can be important for
	  protocols which use more than one port to communicate, such as FTP.
	  However, persistence is not the most efficient way to deal with the
	  problem of grouping together connections destined for different
	  ports. For these situations, it is best to use <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>firewall
	  marks</I
>.

>7.5.2. Firewall Marks</A
></H2
><P
>	  Firewall marks are an easy and efficient way to a group ports used for
	  a protocol or group of related protocols. For instance, if an LVS
	  cluster is deployed to run an e-commerce site, firewall marks can be
	  used to bundle HTTP connections on port 80 and secure, HTTPS
	  connections on port 443. By assigning the same firewall mark to the
	  virtual server for each protocol, state information for the
	  transaction can be preserved because the LVS router forwards all
	  requests to the same real server after a connection is opened.
	</P
><P
>	  Because of its efficiency and ease-of-use, administrators of LVS
	  clusters should use firewall marks instead of persistence whenever
	  possible for grouping connections. However, administrators should
	  still add persistence to the virtual servers in conjunction with
	  firewall marks to ensure the clients are reconnected to the same
	  server for an adequate period of time.
